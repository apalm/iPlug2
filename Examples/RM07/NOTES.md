## Exercise

- add gain knob
- increase number of pads
- ADSR knobs
- sample playback
- white keys, chromatic midi mapping. index is track number. e.g chromatic: [30, 31, 32, ...], white: [30, 32, 34, ...]
- optional name for patterns? e.g. verse, chorus
- what about rests in songs?

## Goals

- XML-based presets like Valhalla, Sitala
- separate presets for songs, patterns, kits
- no gigantic sample library - most people have a ton of samples
- no effects - most people have a ton of third-party VSTs that they prefer
