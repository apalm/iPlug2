## Exercise

- increase number of pads
- ADSR knobs
- sample playback
- optional name for patterns? e.g. verse, chorus
- what about rests in songs?
- what about inserting patterns in the middle of an existing song? wouldn't want to redo everything. see page 12 of LinnDrum manual for how they handle
- what about deleting an existing pattern in the middle of an existing song?
- with Sitala, I think each track (pad) is hardwired to an audio output. not sure if that's desirable?

## Goals

- XML-based presets like Valhalla, Sitala
- separate presets for songs, patterns, kits
- no gigantic sample library - most people have a ton of samples
- no effects - most people have a ton of third-party VSTs that they prefer
